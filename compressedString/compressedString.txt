The code you provided implements a run-length encoding compression algorithm, which compresses a string by replacing consecutive duplicate characters with a single character followed by the count of its occurrences.

Here’s the breakdown of the issues and solutions:

Issues:
Empty String Handling:

The code correctly handles an empty string by setting previous_char to an empty string and ensuring no processing occurs for an empty message.
Final Character Append:

The final character and its count are appended correctly. However, in the case where the message is empty, previous_char is an empty string, and this doesn’t affect the result.
Output Example:

The compressedString("Baasssryy") should return "Ba2s4r1y2", which is correct for run-length encoding. The issue might lie in understanding the expected output.
Solution:
The code looks correct for compressing strings using run-length encoding. However, if you encounter unexpected results, ensure the expected output format matches the compression algorithm’s output.
